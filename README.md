# Task 4: Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts

## 🔍 Objective
Estimate individual medical insurance charges based on personal data using Linear Regression.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Medical Cost Personal Dataset**
- Contains information like: age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, and region.

## 🛠️ Instructions Followed
- Data loaded and cleaned.
- Visualized key features (`age`, `bmi`, `smoker`) vs. `charges`.
- Trained Linear Regression model to predict insurance charges.
- Evaluated model using **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error) and **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error).
- Bonus: Created animated scatter plot using Plotly to visualize charges over age.

## 📊 Visualizations
- Scatter plots for Age vs Charges, BMI vs Charges
- Boxplot to observe outliers
- Correlation heatmap
- Plotly animated graph (BMI vs Charges over Age)

## 📈 Model Performance
- Metrics:
  - MAE: `value_here`
  - RMSE: `value_here`
- Train-test split: 80-20
- Model: Linear Regression (from sklearn)

## 📦 Libraries Used
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- plotly
